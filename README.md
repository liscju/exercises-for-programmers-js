# Exercises for programmers done in javascript language

Project contains my take on exercises from book "Exercises for Programmers"
by Brian P. Hogan done in javascript language.

### Prerequisites

You does not need any special software to run exercises, just launch them
in browser and voila.

## License

Do whatever you want with this software - I do not care as long as you
does not spam me.
